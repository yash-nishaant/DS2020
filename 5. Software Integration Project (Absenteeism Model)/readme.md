## Absenteeism Model 

A machine learning model created to analyze employee absenteeism data (more details in the notebooks). The absenteeism_module folder contains a Python module implementation of the code from absenteeism_module.ipynb. Some Tableau visualizations for the project can be found at https://public.tableau.com/profile/yash.nishaant#!/.
